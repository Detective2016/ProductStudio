Wedge: Speed and Security

Missing Wedge: Cashless

Description:
One of the most useful functions of using mobile applications to find rides through Uber, is the cashless function. However, if tip is not included in the payment already or if riders donâ€™t have the ability to adjust the tip, it would still be necessary to carry cash for tipping purposes. In addition, it adds to another form of payment when riders have already linked their credit cards or bank accounts to the system. The lack of completely cashless system may reduce the number of riders overall.
